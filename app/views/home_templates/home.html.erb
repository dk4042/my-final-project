<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #3d2a15;">What is Specialty Coffee?</h3>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; color: #3d2a15;">
 Specialty coffee refers to coffee that is considered the highest quality available in the coffee industry. It is graded by professional tasters known as Q-graders, who evaluate the coffee based on a range of factors, including flavor, aroma, acidity, body, and balance. To be considered specialty coffee, the beans must score 80 points or above on a 100-point scale. This grading system helps ensure that only coffee of exceptional quality makes the cut.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; color: #3d2a15;">
The term “specialty coffee” is often associated with the coffee’s entire journey from farm to cup. It involves meticulous attention to every detail along the supply chain, from cultivation to processing to brewing. Specialty coffee comes primarily from single-origin or single-estate farms, meaning it’s sourced from a specific geographic location or even a single farm. This allows the coffee’s unique flavor profile, which is influenced by the altitude, climate, soil, and agricultural practices of that region, to shine.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; color: #3d2a15;">
Additionally, the emphasis on sustainability, traceability, and ethical practices in specialty coffee has gained traction in recent years. Many specialty coffee producers and roasters emphasize direct trade relationships, ensuring that farmers receive fair compensation for their high-quality beans. This connection between producer and consumer helps foster transparency and promotes better working conditions for coffee farmers.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; color: #3d2a15;">
In short, specialty coffee is not just about quality—it’s a movement that emphasizes sustainable farming practices, ethical trade, and the celebration of diverse coffee flavors from around the world.
